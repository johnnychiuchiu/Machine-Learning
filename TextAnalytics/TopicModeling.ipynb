    "There are many time that we would have a large collection of documents (let's call them corpus) and would like to somehow identify the topics among these documents. Since the corpus might be large, it would be very difficult for us to know how to define those topics that can cover each of the documents, not to mention to hand label them one by one. Furthermore, each documents can potentially be related to multiple topics. For example, Online booking platform Airbnb may want to [discover and classifying in-app message](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/discovering-and-classifying-in-app-message-intent-at-airbnb-6a55f5400a0c) to help them better understand guest intent in order to provide a more seamless communication experience for both their guests and hosts.

    "The first sentence, “Could you recommend some things to do in the area?”, is a general ask. However the next sentence in the same message, “We were looking to go to a public beach or lake”, apparently has very specific intent.
