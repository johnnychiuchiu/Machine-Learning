    "This problem involves using kernel methods to predict cost for the ischemic heart disease data. Since the loess() function in R allows at most four predictors, and the ischemic heart disease data involves eight predictors, you will have to choose a good subset of four predictors to work with. From HW2, the best regression tree had the three predictors intvn, comorb, and dur, so these three should probably be in the model. These three also had the smallest P-values from the linear regression fit from HW2 and from the GAM fit in problem 2 above, and the VIFs were all small, so the other larger P-values are not distorted by multicollinearity. The predictor comp had the next smallest P-value in HW2 and in the GAM fit above, but it is discrete, which will cause an error in loess(). So as the fourth predictor for this problem, use ervis, which appears to be the next most relevant predictor from the GAM fit above.\n",
